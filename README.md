# Circulate-the-values-of-N-variables
## Aim:
To write a python program to circulate the n variables using function concept
## Equipmentâ€™s required:
PC
Anaconda - Python 3.7
## Algorithm: 
### Step 1: 
Initialise a list 
### Step 2: 
Assign the value of variable to a temporary variable
### Step 3: 
Get the value from the user for the number of rotation
### Step 4: 
Using the slicing concept rotate the list

### Step 5: 
Print both the values it would be interchanged
### Step 6: 
End the program
## Program:

## Output:

## Result:
Thus the program has been executed successfully.
